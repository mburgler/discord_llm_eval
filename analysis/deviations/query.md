The fight of the Swiss women for equal treatment with respect to political rights was won as late as 1971 (federal level) and 1990 (Canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden). Before, women could not participate in elections and referenda.\nii. When an individual invokes in a case a fundamental right which is enshrined in the ECHR, the Federal Supreme Court is ready to review a federal act as to its conformity with the ECHR; in case the Federal Supreme Court finds that the federal act is not compatible with the ECHR, it does not apply the act.\niii. Limited constitutional review which is a particularity of the Swiss political system also encompasses cantonal acts and ordinances: The Federal Supreme Court is not empowered to review cantonal acts and ordinances as to their compatibility with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution.\niv. The Federal Constitution contains an impressive catalogue of fundamental rights. This catalogue is based on the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), but it also contains additional rights, which are not guaranteed by the ECHR, such as economic freedom.\nv. It is problematic when a popular initiative, such as the initiative “against the construction of minarets” (2009), is incompatible with the ECHR. Nonetheless, it is possible to propose such an initiative, and it is submitted to the vote of the people and the cantons, if the necessary 100’000 signatures are collected.\n\nChoices:\nA) i, ii, iii, and v\nB) i and iii\nC) i, ii, iv, and v\nD) iv\nE) I don't know\n\nBefore answering, think about the question step by step.\nAnswer only if you are confident, since mistakes are penalized with -1 points, while correct answers receive 1 point, and the answer E) \"I don't know\" always receives 0 points.\n\nFormat your final answer as follows:\nFinal Answer: ###C###\n\nAnswer:\n"
