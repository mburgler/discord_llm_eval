      "**Examining the Process**\n\nI'm currently breaking down the request into actionable steps. The core is an expert-level multiple-choice question on Swiss law. I plan to use a structured, chain-of-thought approach to ensure a thorough and accurate response. The goal is to provide a precise answer that demonstrates mastery of the subject matter.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Approach**\n\nI'm now refining the strategy. The prompt requires a structured legal analysis as the response, not a raw dump of my internal reasoning. The key is to balance providing the required format (Facts, Issue, Rule, etc.) with the security instruction that prevents exposing my underlying thought process. I will keep the \"reasoning\" section concise, focusing on the final legal outcome. The goal is to provide a comprehensive answer that adheres to the user's requirements while maintaining model integrity.\n\n\n**Analyzing Legal Capacity**\n\nI'm now deep-diving into the legal capacity aspect. Evaluating Statement ii requires a clear understanding of *Handlungsfähigkeit* under Swiss law. The aim is to define the exact legal effect and determine if the statement accurately represents it. I'm focusing on providing an accurate legal definition within the answer, referencing relevant articles if required.\n\n\n**Refining Legal Distinction**\n\nI'm currently delving into the specifics of *Urteilsfähigkeit* versus *Handlungsfähigkeit* in Swiss law. My focus is pinpointing when a person lacking capacity of judgement *can* still create legal effects. The rule is clear: generally, actions without capacity of judgement are void. I'm carefully examining exceptions like tort liability and lucid intervals, as these nuances are crucial for the legal analysis. I'm focusing on providing the most precise and defensible interpretation.\n\n\n**Investigating the Nuances**\n\nI'm now focusing on the intricacies of legal effect creation when capacity of judgement is absent. I've re-evaluated the impact of Art. 19b ZGB regarding personal rights, which is an important exception to Art. 18 ZGB. The core of my current work is determining if the statement is factually correct. Also, I am looking more closely at Art. 54 OR and the \"bona fide\" exception. The aim is to find any other relevant exceptions.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Initiative**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on Statement iii, specifically the intersection of Swiss constitutional law and *ius cogens*. The key question is whether international human rights law, such as the ECHR, always equates to *ius cogens*. My analysis suggests that, while there's some overlap, they are not synonymous. My focus is on providing a precise legal distinction.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Verdict**\n\nI'm now putting the final touches on the evaluation. Based on the previous analyses, I can confidently assess the validity of the statements. Statement ii requires a deeper dive into tort liability and Art. 54 OR. I'm focusing on providing a comprehensive legal analysis that aligns with the prompt's requirements. The key is to demonstrate a thorough understanding of Swiss law.\n\n\n**Assessing the Logic**\n\nI've determined that all three statements are false, leading me to option A. I'm now double-checking statement ii, specifically, to pinpoint the nuances around when actions lacking judgement create legal effects. I'm considering scenarios like causing harm in torts, but focusing on how this influences the overall legal outcome. I'm carefully analyzing the distinction between causing an event and creating a legal effect in the context of Swiss civil law to confirm the reasoning.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Logic**\n\nI've determined the answer, so I'm now crafting the final structure. The statements (i-iii) have been individually analyzed. Solferino and the US Civil War are the focus for (i), confirming its falsehood. I'm focusing on the \"void\" aspect of Art. 18 ZGB to address (ii). Finally, ECHR versus *ius cogens* is the key for (iii), which will lead to the most concise output for the answer.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Analysis**\n\nI'm now integrating the user's specific request for reasoning into the final structured answer. My conclusion is that all the options are wrong. I will use the facts, issue, and rule structure for all three statements. My reasoning will be concise, focusing on the legal outcome. I will explain in the answer how statement iii is false. I will also make clear why the ECHR and *ius cogens* have distinct meanings in the final answer.\n\n\n"
