      "**Evaluating Swiss Civil Law**\n\nI'm now diving deep into this multiple-choice question. I'm focusing on dissecting each statement, beginning with the Lugano Convention's impact. The goal is to determine which of the provided statements accurately reflect Swiss civil procedure. This requires close attention to detail and nuanced understanding.\n\n\n**Considering Judicial Appointments**\n\nI've shifted my attention to the second statement, which concerns judge appointments. It's quickly becoming apparent that this statement is likely false, given Switzerland's emphasis on judicial independence. Further research into the exact appointment procedures is underway, which will involve an evaluation of any potential political influences.\n\n\n**Examining Factual Establishment**\n\nThe analysis continues to refine the understanding of fact-finding within Swiss civil procedures. Considering statement iii, I've noted the dominance of the *maxime des débats*, yet I must further explore the nuances of judicial involvement, particularly the exceptions and potential for a more inquisitorial approach under specific circumstances. The goal is to determine the extent of a judge's active role.\n\n\n**Deliberating on Judicial Roles**\n\nI'm now honing in on the details of fact-finding within Swiss civil cases, aiming to discern the validity of statement iii. My current understanding highlights the *maxime des débats* as the core principle, but I'm wrestling with the nuances. The statement’s wording about judges being *very actively involved* seems questionable, especially considering the judge's limited role in typical civil disputes.\n\n\n**Examining the Core Principles**\n\nNow, I'm analyzing the third statement concerning judges' involvement in fact-finding. I've concluded that it's likely incorrect, given the *maxime des débats*. While judges can clarify and manage, the statement's implication of active fact-establishment as a general practice seems misleading.\n\n\n**Confirming Representation Absence**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in Statement iv, which focuses on mandatory legal representation. After confirming that the Swiss Code of Civil Procedure offers no generalized requirement for legal counsel, I'm examining any potential exceptions or specific situations where representation might be compulsory, and evaluating how it would affect the user's answer.\n\n\n**Assessing the Statements' Accuracy**\n\nI'm now focused on the final synthesis of the multiple-choice question. By eliminating incorrect statements, and after re-evaluating iii, I am now confident about the final answer. My analysis has led to a conclusive understanding of the Swiss Civil Procedure, allowing me to confirm the answer.\n\n\n**Refining Answer Selection**\n\nI'm now carefully re-evaluating the statements, particularly iii, aiming for absolute certainty. Analyzing fact-finding in civil cases, the *maxime des débats* places responsibility with the parties. Although judges can clarify, and have an active role in evidence-taking, the statement's implication of constant judicial fact-establishment seems inaccurate. The correct answer is now secure.\n\n\n**Concluding the Assessment**\n\nThe final evaluation is now complete. The multiple-choice question on Swiss Civil Procedure has been thoroughly examined. Considering the principles involved, and after reevaluating each option, C (Statements i and ii) presents the most accurate depiction of the Swiss legal system, and is the correct answer.\n\n\n**Concluding Assessments**\n\nI'm now confident in the final answer. The analysis of the four statements is complete. Considering the core principles and re-evaluating each option, the selection of C (Statements i and ii), reflecting the accurate characterization of the Swiss legal system, has been affirmed.\n\n\n**Confirming Final Conclusions**\n\nI'm now fully confident about my answer. After verifying each statement, I am now certain that the influence of the Lugano Convention on jurisdictional rules (i) and the role of political affiliation in judge appointments (ii) are accurate. Given that representation is not always mandatory (iv), and judges are not always very actively involved in fact-finding (iii), the answer remains **C**.\n\n\n**Reflecting on the Answer**\n\nI am now completely confident in my final determination. After a thorough review of each statement, taking into account the nuances of Swiss civil procedure, and particularly the interplay between the *maxime des débats* and the judge's role, the correct answer is unequivocally **C**.\n\n\n**Finalizing Answer Verification**\n\nI'm now fully confident about my answer. Reviewing the core principles, I'm certain that the Lugano Convention's influence (i) and the role of political affiliation in judge appointments (ii) are accurate. Given that representation is not always mandatory (iv), and judges are generally not actively involved in fact-finding (iii), the correct answer is unequivocally **C**.\n\n\n**Reviewing Answer Consistency**\n\nI'm now revisiting the statements, ensuring my conclusions align. Considering the *Verhandlungsmaxime* in Swiss civil procedure, I re-evaluated statement iii. Though judges facilitate evidence, the parties remain responsible for fact establishment. Thus, the statement's implication of constant judicial fact-finding is inaccurate.\n\n\n**Reflecting on the Outcome**\n\nAfter reevaluating each option, the analysis confirms the selection of C (Statements i and ii) as the most accurate. The Lugano Convention's influence and political appointments are key aspects.\n\n\n"
